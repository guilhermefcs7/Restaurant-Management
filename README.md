# Restaurant-Management
Complete restaurant management software

# Description

Our restaurant management software is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in the food service industry. With a user-friendly interface, it empowers waitstaff to easily 
open customer tables and register their orders, while kitchen staff can seamlessly track and fulfill these orders through the web-based system.

Backend Powered by Node.js and JWT Token-based Route Protection:
Built on the robust Node.js framework, our software ensures high performance and scalability. To guarantee secure access, we implement JWT tokens as a configuration for route protection, allowing only authenticated 
users to interact with the system. This provides an additional layer of security for your restaurant's data.

Seamless Database Integration with PostgreSQL and Prisma:
Our software leverages the power of PostgreSQL, a reliable and feature-rich database management system, to store and organize restaurant data efficiently. Prisma serves as a bridge, seamlessly connecting the backend 
with the database, ensuring smooth communication and data integrity.

Front-End Development with React.js and React Native:
The front-end of our software is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library renowned for its versatility and performance. This ensures a seamless and responsive user interface on web-based platforms. 
Moreover, our software extends its functionality to mobile devices, with a dedicated React Native framework, enabling users to access and manage restaurant operations on the go.
